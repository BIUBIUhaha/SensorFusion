# SensorFusion
This project performs sensor fusion to track a mobile device's orientation. The data utilised are from three sensors: a) Accelerometer, b) Magnetic Field, d) Gyroscope. The sensor fusion is executed off-line. This project basically ports code developed by Paul Lawitzki from Android to Matlab/Octave.
